Simple Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent
This repository contains an implementation of a simple logistic regression model using gradient descent to estimate the parameters. The code is designed to demonstrate the process of training a logistic regression model on a simulated dataset with noise and evaluating its performance.

Description
Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing datasets in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).
In this implementation, we use gradient descent to minimize the cost function and estimate the parameters (weights and bias) of the logistic regression model.
